<h3>One Page Site</h3>
<p>There was a very tight turn-around on this build as the site was being developed in conjunction with <a href="http://www.propcom.co.uk" target="_blank">Propeller Communications</a>, whom are the main sponsor of the group.</p>
<p>The site is primarily going to be used to provide information to upcoming events, with links to all their social media outlets.</p>
<p>I developed a single page website as there wasn't enough content to spread over multiple pages. It includes some elegant animations as you scroll down the page for a friendly-feel to the site.</p>

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
<p>Because this user group is fairly new, the website is only basic. The future will plan to incorporate an <a href="{{ route('project', 'admin-panel') }}">Admin Panel</a> into the site to enable the managing of events and inclusion of a Twitter &amp; Instagram feed.</p>
