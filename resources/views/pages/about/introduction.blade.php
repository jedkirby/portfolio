			<h2>James Kirby</h2>
			
			<p>Whilst I primarily work with backend web technologies, like <a href="https://php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a>, I think of myself as a hybrid web developer by utilizing my skills for both front and backend as well as keeping in touch with my creative side designing websites, logos and icons.</p>

			<p>I work in both <a href="https://lemp.io" target="_blank">LEMP</a> and <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/L/LAMP.html" target="_blank">LAMP</a> environments and pride myself on my ability to use multiple frameworks, such as; <a href="http://laravel.com" target="_blank">Laravel</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com" target="_blank">Symfony</a>, <a href="http://codeigniter.com" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a> and <a href="http://fuelphp.com" target="_blank">FuelPHP</a>, aside from those I've got great experience in hand coding and bug fixing in native PHP.</p>

			<p>I'm currently looking for remote projects, if this fits your needs then head over to the <a href="{{ \URL::to('contact', ['interested']) }}">contact page</a> and lets talk.</p>
